    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      My name is <strong>Girum Wanoro</strong>. I was born and raised in Ethiopia and moved to the
      United States when I was 12 years old. I’m currently a student at the University of Washington,
      majoring in <strong>Geography with Data Science</strong> and minoring in <strong>Business Administration</strong>.
      Growing up in an immigrant family taught me resilience, independence, and the importance of community.

    <h2>My Interests & Goals</h2>
    <p>
      I’ve always been curious about how people and places connect. My academic work in geography
      has helped me understand how data can tell stories about human experience — from mapping
      migration to studying social patterns. In the future, I hope to use data science to create
      positive change in underserved communities and promote equity through education and access.
